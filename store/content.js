Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin Russell. I am a 25 year old Minneapolis based developer with three years of professional experience. 

My specialties are creating reusable components for teams, making cool user interactions with SCSS and Typescript, Vue.js, and whatever interesting thing I'm trying to learn currently. (Pssst Rust and web assembly! Super cool and possibly the future of web ðŸ˜œ).

I've worked the last three years at a small, fast paced marketing company where I have (with a team and also single handedly) made many apps, websites and landing pages.

I'm ready to grow and learn so I am currently looking for a new job and would love to talk.`,
